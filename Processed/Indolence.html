<p>Mr. Charles Derbyshire, who put Rizal&rsquo;s great novel <i lang=
"es">Noli me tangere</i> and its sequel <i lang="es">El
Filibusterismo</i> into English (as <i>The Social Cancer</i> and <i>The
Reign of Greed</i>), besides many minor writings of the &ldquo;Greatest
Man of the Brown Race&rdquo;, has rendered a similar service for
<i lang="es">La Indolencia de los Filipinos</i> in the following pages,
and with that same fidelity and sympathetic comprehension of the
author&rsquo;s meaning which has made possible an understanding of the
real Rizal by English readers. Notes by Dr.&nbsp;James A. Robertson
(Librarian of the Philippine Library and co-editor of the 55-volume
series of historical reprints well called <i>The Philippine Islands
1493&ndash;1898</i>, so comprehensive are they) show the breadth of
Rizal&rsquo;s historical scholarship, and that the only error mentioned
is due to using a faulty reprint where the original was not available
indicates the conscientiousness of the pioneer worker.</p>
<p>An appropriate setting has been attempted by page decorations whose
scenes are taken from Philippine textbooks of the World Book Company
and whose borders were made in the Drawing Department of the Philippine
School of Arts and Trades.</p>
<p>The frontispiece shows a hurried pencil sketch of himself which
Rizal made in Berlin in the Spring of 1887 that Prof. Blumentritt, whom
then he knew only through correspondence, might recognize him at the
Leitmeritz railway station when he should arrive for a proposed visit.
The photograph from which the engraving was reproduced came one year
ago with the Christmas greetings of the Austrian professor whose recent
death the Philippine Islands, who knew him as their friend and
Rizal&rsquo;s, is mourning.</p>
<p>The picture perhaps deserves a couple of comments. As a child Rizal
had been trained to rapid work, an expertness kept up by practice, and
the copying of his own countenance from a convenient near-by mirror was
but a moment&rsquo;s task. Yet the incident suggests that he did not
keep photographs of himself about, and that he had the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e132" href="#xd21e132" name=
"xd21e132">6</a>]</span>Cromwellian desire to see himself as he really
was, for the Filipino features are more prominent than in any
photograph of his extant.</p>
<p>The essay itself originally appeared in the Filipino forthrightly
review, <i lang="es">La Solidaridad</i>, of Madrid, in five
installments, running from July 15 to September 15, 1890. It was a
continuation of Rizal&rsquo;s campaign of education in which he sought
by blunt truths to awaken his countrymen to their own faults at the
same time that he was arousing the Spaniards to the defects in
Spain&rsquo;s colonial system that caused and continued such
shortcomings.</p>
<p>To-day there seems a place in Manila for just suets, missionary work
as <i>The Indolence of the Filipino</i> aimed at. It may help on the
present improving understanding between Continental Americans and their
countrymen of these &ldquo;Far Off Eden Isles&rdquo;, for the writer
submits as his mature opinion, based on ten years&rsquo; acquaintance
among Filipinos through studies which enlisted their interest, that the
political problem would have been greatly simplified had it been
understood in Dewey&rsquo;s day that among intelligent Americans the
much-talked-of lack of &ldquo;capacity&rdquo; referred to the mass of
the people&rsquo;s want of political experience and not to any alleged
racial inferiority. To wounded pride has the discontent been due rather
than to withholding of political privileges.</p>
<p>Spanish Philippine history has curiously repeated itself during the
fifteen years of America&rsquo;s administration of this
archipelago.</p>
<p>Just as some colonial Spaniards seemed to the Filipinos less
creditable representatives of the metropolis than the average of those
who remained in the Peninsula, so not all who now pass for Americans in
the Philippines are believed here to measure up to the highest
homestandard.</p>
<p>Sitters in swivel-chairs underneath electric fans hold hopeless the
future of the land where men do not desire to be drudges just as did
their predecessors who in wide armed lazy seats, beneath punkahs,
talked of Filipino indolence.</p>
<p>Ingratitude, to-day as then, is the regular rejoinder to the
progressing people&rsquo;s protest against paternalism, and altruistic
regard for their real welfare is still represented <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e153" href="#xd21e153" name=
"xd21e153">7</a>]</span>as the reason why special legislation should be
provided when Filipinos prefer the same laws as govern the sovereign
people.</p>
<p>Though those who claim to champion the Philippines&rsquo; cause
apparently are unaware of it, these Islands have a population strangely
alike in its make up to the people of America; their history is full of
American associations; Americans developed their leading resources, and
American ideas have inspired their political aspirations. It betrays
blindness somewhere that ever since 1898 Filipinos have been trying to
get loose from America in order to set up here an American form of
government,</p>
<p>There seems now a, prospect that insular legislation may make
available to the individual the guarantees of personal liberty upon
which America at home prides itself, that municipal self-government and
provincial autonomy may become realities in the Philippines, and
possibly even that both Filipinos and Americans may realize before it
is too late how our elastic territorial government could be made to
exact from them much less of their independence than the sacrifice of
sovereignty necessary in Neutralization or internationalization.</p>
<p>Unwillingness to work when there is nothing in it for them is common
to Filipinos and Americans, for Thomas Jefferson admitted that
extravagance and indolence were the chief faults of his countrymen.
Labor-saving machinery has made the fruits of Americans&rsquo; labors
in their land of abundance afford a luxury in living not elsewhere
existing. But the Filipino, in his rich and not over-populated home,
shutting out, as we do, oriental cheap labor, may employ American
machinery and attain the same standard. The possibilities for the
prosperity of the population put the Philippines in the New World, just
as their discovery and their history group them with the Western
Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Doctor Sancianco, in his <i lang="es">Progreso de Filipinas</i>,
(<a href="#n1">1</a>), has taken up this question, <i>agitated</i>, as
he calls it, and, relying upon facts and reports furnished by the very
same Spanish authorities that rule the Philippines, has demonstrated
that such indolence does not exist, and that all said about it does not
deserve reply or even passing notice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as discussion of it has been continued, not only by
government employees who make it responsible for their own
shortcomings, not only by the friars who regard it as necessary in
order that they may continue to represent, themselves as indispensable,
but also by serious and disinterested persons; and as evidence of
greater or less weight may be adduced in opposition to that which Dr.
Sancianco cites, it seems expedient, to us to study this question
thoroughly, without superciliousness or sensitiveness, without
prejudice, without pessimism. And as we can only serve our country by
telling the truth, however bit, tee it be, just as a flat and skilful
negation cannot refute a real and positive fact, in spite of the
brilliance of the arguments; as a mere affirmation is not sufficient to
create something impossible, let us calmly examine the facts, using on
our part all the impartiality of which a man is capable who is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e190" href="#xd21e190" name=
"xd21e190">10</a>]</span>convinced that there is no redemption except
upon solid bases of virtue.</p>
<p>The word indolence has been greatly misused in the sense of little
love for work and lack of energy, while ridicule has concealed the
misuse. This much-discussed question has met with the same fate as
certain panaceas and specifies of the quacks who by ascribing to them
impossible virtues have discredited them. In the Middle Ages, and even
in some Catholic countries now, the devil is blamed for everything that
superstitious folk cannot understand or the perversity of mankind is
loath to confess. In the Philippines one&rsquo;s own and
another&rsquo;s faults, the shortcomings of one, the misdeeds of
another, are attributed to indolence. And just as in the Middle Ages he
who sought the explanation of phenomena outside of infernal influences
was persecuted, so in the Philippines worse happens to him who seeks
the origin of the trouble outside of accepted beliefs.</p>
<p>The consequence of this misuse is that there are some who are
interested in stating it as a dogma and others in combating it as a
ridiculous superstition, if not a punishable delusion. Yet it is not to
be inferred from the misuse of a thing that it does not exist.</p>
<p>We think that there must be something behind all this outcry, for it
is incredible that so many should err, among whom we have said there
are a lot of serious and disinterested persons. Some act in bad faith,
through levity, through want of sound judgment, through limitation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e198" href="#xd21e198" name=
"xd21e198">11</a>]</span>in reasoning power, ignorance of the past, or
other cause. Some repeat what they have heard, without, examination or
reflection; others speak through pessimism or are impelled by that
human characteristic which paints as perfect everything that belongs to
oneself and defective whatever belongs to another. But it cannot be
denied that there are some who worship truth, or if not truth itself at
least the semblance thereof, which is truth in the mind of the
crowd.</p>
<p>Examining well, then, all the scenes and all the men that we have
known from Childhood, and the life of our country, we believe that
indolence does exist there. The Filipinos, who can measure up with the
most active peoples in the world, will doubtless not repudiate this
admission, for it is true that there one works and struggles against
the climate, against nature and against men. But we must not take the
exception for the general rule, and should rather seek the good of our
country by stating what we believe to be true. We must confess that
indolence does actually and positively exist there; only that, instead
of holding it to be the <i>cause</i> of the backwardness and the
trouble, we regard it as the <i>effect</i> of the trouble and the
backwardness, by fostering the development of <i>a lamentable
predisposition</i>.</p>
<p>Those who have as yet treated of indolence, with the exception of
Dr. Sancianco, have been content to deny or affirm it. We know of no
one who has studied its causes. Nevertheless, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e213" href="#xd21e213" name=
"xd21e213">12</a>]</span>those who admit its existence and exaggerate
it more or less have not therefore failed to advise remedies taken from
here and there, from Java, from India, from other English or Dutch
colonies, like the quack who saw a fever cured with a dozen sardines
and afterwards always prescribed these fish at every rise in
temperature that he discovered in his patients.</p>
<p>We shall proceed otherwise. Before proposing a remedy we shall
examine the causes, and even though strictly speaking a predisposition
is not a cause, let us, however, study at its true value this
predisposition due to nature.</p>
<p>The predisposition exists? Why shouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>A hot, climate requires of the individual quiet and rest, just as
cold incites to labor and action. For this reason the Spaniard is more
indolent than the Frenchman; the Frenchman more so than the German. The
Europeans themselves who reproach the residents of the colonies so much
(and I am not now speaking of the Spaniards but of the Germans and
English themselves), how do they live in tropical countries? Surrounded
by a numerous train of servants, never going afoot but riding in a
carriage, needing servants not only to take off their shoes for them
but even to fan them! And yet they live and eat better, they work for
themselves to get rich, with the hope of a future, free and respected,
while the poor colonist, the <i>indolent</i> colonist, is badly
nourished, has no hope, toils for others, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e225" href="#xd21e225" name=
"xd21e225">13</a>]</span>works under force and compulsion! Perhaps the
reply to this will be that white men are not made to stand the severity
of the climate. A mistake! A man can live in any climate, if he will
only adapt himself to its requirements and conditions. What kills the
European in hot countries is the abuse of liquors, the attempt to live
according to the nature of his own country under another sky and
another sun. We inhabitants of hot countries live well in northern
Europe whenever we take the precautions the people there do. Europeans
can also stand the torrid zone, if only they would get rid of their
prejudices. (2) The fact is that in tropical countries violent work is
not a good thing as it is in cold countries, there it is death,
destruction, annihilation. Nature knows this and like a just mother has
therefore made the earth more fertile, more productive, as a
compensation. An hour&rsquo;s work under that burning sun, in the midst
of pernicious influences springing from nature in activity, is equal to
a day&rsquo;s work in a temperate climate; it is, then, just that the
earth yield a hundred fold! Moreover, do we not see the active
European, who has gained strength during the winter, who feels the
fresh blood of spring boil in his veins, do we not see him abandon his
labors during the few days of his variable summer, close his
office&mdash;where the work is not violent and amounts for many to
talking and gesticulating in the shade and beside a
lunch-stand,&mdash;flee to watering <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e227" href="#xd21e227" name="xd21e227">14</a>]</span> places, sit
in the caf&eacute;s or stroll about? What wonder then that the
inhabitant of tropical countries, worm out and with his blood thinned
by the continuous and excessive heat, is reduced to inaction? Who is
the indolent one in the Manila offices? Is it the poor clerk who comes
in at eight in the morning and leaves at, one in the afternoon with
only his parasol, who copies and writes and works for himself and for
his chief, or is it the chief, who comes in a carriage at ten
o&rsquo;clock, leaves before twelve, reads his newspaper while smoking
and with is feet cocked up on a chair or a table, or gossiping about
all his friends? Which is indolent, the native coadjutor, poorly paid
and badly treated, who has to visit all the indigent sick living in the
country, or the friar curate who gets fabulously rich, goes about in a
carriage, eats and drinks well, and does not put himself to any trouble
without collecting excessive fees? [<a href="#n3">3</a>]</p>
<p>Without speaking further of the Europeans, in what violent labor
does the Chinaman engage in tropical countries, the industrious
Chinaman, who flees from his own country driven by hunger and want, and
whose whole ambition is to amass a small fortune? With the exception of
some porters, an occupation that the natives also follow, he nearly
always engages in trade, in commerce; so rarely does he take up
agriculture that we do not know of a single case. The Chinaman who in
other colonies cultivates the soil does so only for a certain number of
years and then retires. [<a href="#n4">4</a>]</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e238" href="#xd21e238" name=
"xd21e238">15</a>]</span>We find, then, the tendency to indolence very
natural, and have to admit and bless it, for we cannot alter natural
laws, and without it the race would have disappeared. Man is not a
brute, he is not a, machine; his object is not merely to produce, in
spite of the pretensions of some Christian whites who would make of the
colored Christian a kind of motive power somewhat more intelligent and
less costly than steam. Man&rsquo;s object is not to satisfy tile
passions of another man, his object is to seek happiness for himself
and his kind by traveling along the road of progress and
perfection.</p>
<p>The evil is not that indolence exists more or less latently but that
it is fostered and magnified. Among men, as well as among nations,
there exist not only aptitudes but also tendencies toward good and
evil. To foster the good ones and aid them, as well as correct the evil
and repress them, would be the duty of society and governments, if less
noble thoughts did not occupy their attention. The evil is that the
indolence in the Philippines is a magnified indolence, an indolence of
the snowball type, if we may be permitted the expression, an evil that
increases in direct proportion to the square of the periods of time, an
<i>effect</i> of misgovernment and of backwardness, as we said, and not
a <i>cause</i> thereof. Others will hold the contrary opinion,
especially those who have a hand in the misgovernment, but we do not
care; we have made an assertion and are going to prove it. <span class=

<p class="first">When in consequence of a long chronic illness the
condition of the patient is examined, the question may arise whether
the weakening of the fibers and the debility of the organs are the
cause of the malady&rsquo;s continuing or the effect of the bad
treatment that prolongs its action. The attending physician attributes
the entire failure of his skill to the poor constitution of the
patient, to the climate, to the surroundings, and so on. On the other
hand, the patient attributes the aggravation of the evil to the system
of treatment followed. Only the common crowd, the inquisitive populace,
shakes its head and cannot reach a decision<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span></p>
<p>Something like this happens in the case of the Philippines. Instead
of physician, read government, that is, friars, employees, etc. Instead
of patient, Philippines; instead of malady, indolence.</p>
<p>And, just as happens in similar cases then the patient gets worse,
everybody loses his head, each one dodges the responsibility to place
it upon somebody else, and instead of seeking the causes in order to
combat the evil in them, devotes himself at best to attacking the
symptoms: here a blood-letting, a tax; there a plaster, forced labor;
further on a sedative, a trifling reform. Every new arrival proposes a
new remedy: one, seasons of prayer, the relics of a saint, the
viaticum, the friars; another, a shower-bath; still <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e261" href="#xd21e261" name=
"xd21e261">17</a>]</span>another, with pretensions to modern ideas, a
transfusion of blood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, only the patient has
eight million indolent red corpuscles: some few white corpuscles in the
form of an agricultural colony will get us out of the
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, on all sides there are groans, gnawing of lips, clenching of
fists, many hollow words, great ignorance, a deal of talk, a lot of
fear. The patient is near his finish!</p>
<p>Yes, transfusion of blood, transfusion of blood! New life, new
vitality! Yes, the new white corpuscles that you are going to inject
into its veins, the new white corpuscles that were a cancer in another
organism will withstand all the depravity of the system, will withstand
the blood-lettings that it suffers every day, will have more stamina
than all the eight million red corpuscles, will cure all the disorders,
all the degeneration, all the trouble in the principal organs. Be
thankful if they do not become coagulations and produce gangrene, be
thankful if they do not reproduce the cancer!</p>
<p>While the patient breathes, we must not lose hope, and however late
we be, a judicious examination is never superfluous; at least the cause
of death may be known. We are not trying to put all the blame on the
physician, and still less on the patient, for we have already spoken of
a predisposition due to the climate, a reasonable and natural
predisposition, in the absence of which the race would disappear,
sacrificed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e269" href="#xd21e269"
name="xd21e269">18</a>]</span>excessive labor in a tropical
country.</p>
<p>Indolence in the Philippines is a chronic malady, but not a
hereditary one. The Filipinos have not always been what they are,
witnesses whereto are all the historians of the first years after the
discovery of the Islands.</p>
<p>Before the arrival of the Europeans, the Malayan Filipinos carried
on an active trade, not only among themselves but also with all the
neighboring countries. A Chinese manuscript of the 13th century,
translated by Dr. Hirth (Globus, Sept. 1889), which we will take up at
another time, speaks of China&rsquo;s relations with the islands,
relations purely commercial, in which mention is made of the activity
and honesty of the traders of Luzon, who took the Chinese products and
distributed them throughout all the islands, traveling for nine months,
and then returned to pay religiously even for the merchandise that the
Chinamen did not remember to have given them. The products which they
in exchange exported from the islands were crude wax, cotton, pearls,
tortoise-shell, betel-nuts, dry-goods, etc. [<a href="#n5">5</a>]</p>
<p>The first thing noticed by Pigafetta, who came with Magellan in
1521, on arriving at the first island of the Philippines, Samar, was
the courtesy and kindness of the inhabitants and their commerce.
&ldquo;To honor our captain,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;they conducted him
to their boats where they had their merchandise, which consisted of
cloves, cinnamon, pepper, nutmegs, mace, gold and other things; and
they made us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e280" href="#xd21e280"
name="xd21e280">19</a>]</span>understand by gestures that such articles
were to be found in the islands to which we were going.&rdquo;
[<a href="#n6">6</a>]</p>
<p>Further on he speaks of the vessels and utensils of solid gold that
he found in Butuan, where the people worked mines. He describes the
silk dresses, the daggers with long gold hilts and scabbards of carved
wood, the gold, sets of teeth, etc. Among cereals and fruits he
mentions rice, millet, oranges, lemons, panicum, etc.</p>
<p>That the islands maintained relations with neighboring countries and
even with distant ones is proven by the ships from Siam, laden with
gold and slaves, that Magellan found in Cebu. These ships paid certain
duties to the King of the island. In the same year, 1521, the survivors
of Magellan&rsquo;s expedition met the son of the Rajah of Luzon, who,
as captain-general of the Sultan of Borneo and admiral of his fleet,
had conquered for him the great city of Lave (Sarawak?). Might this
captain, who was greatly feared by all his foes, have been the Rajah
Matanda whom the Spaniards afterwards encountered in Tondo in 1570?</p>
<p>In 1539 the warriors of Luzon took part in the formidable contests
of Sumatra, and under the orders of Angi Siry Timor, Rajah of Batta,
conquered and overthrew the terrible Alzadin, Sultan of Atchin,
renowned in the historical annals of the Far East. (Marsden, Hist. of
Sumatra, Chap. XX.) (<a href="#n7">7</a>)</p>
<p>At that time, that sea where float the islands like a set of
emeralds on a paten of bright <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e297"
href="#xd21e297" name="xd21e297">20</a>]</span>glass, that sea was
everywhere traversed by junks, <i>paraus, barangays</i>, <i>vintas</i>,
vessels swift as shuttles, so large that they could maintain a hundred
rowers on a side (Morga;) that sea bore everywhere commerce, industry,
agriculture, by the force of the oars moved to the sound of warlike
songs (<a href="#n8">8</a>) of the genealogies and achievements of the
Philippine divinities. (Colin, Chap. XV.) (<a href="#n9">9</a>)</p>
<p>Wealth abounded in the islands. Pigafetta tells us of the abundance
of foodstuffs in Paragua and of its inhabitants, who nearly all tilled
their own fields. At this island the survivors of Magellan&rsquo;s
expedition were well received and provisioned. A little later, these
same survivors captured a vessel, plundered and sacked it, add took
prisoner in it the chief of the Island of Paragua (!) with his son and
brother. (<a href="#n10">10</a>)</p>
<p>In this same vessel they captured bronze lombards, and this is the
first mention of artillery of the Filipinos, for these lombards were
useful to the chief of Paragua against the savages of the interior.</p>
<p>They let him ransom himself within seven days, demanding 400
measures (<i>cavanes?</i>) of rice, 20 pigs, 20 goats, and 450
chickens. This is the first act of piracy recorded in Philippine
history. The chief of Paragua paid everything, and moreover
<i>voluntarily</i> added coconuts, bananas, and sugar-cane jars filled
with palm-wine. When Caesar was taken prisoner by the corsairs and
required to pay twenty five talents ransom, he replied;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e326" href=
"#xd21e326" name="xd21e326">21</a>]</span>give you fifty, but later
I&rsquo;ll have you all crucified!&rdquo; The chief of Paragua was more
generous: he forgot. His conduct, while it may reveal weakness, also
demonstrates that the islands were abundantly provisioned. This chief
was named Tuan Mahamud; his brother, Guantil, and his son, Tuan
Mahamed. (Martin Mendez, Purser of the ship <i>Victoria</i>:
<span lang="es">Archivos de Indias</span>.)</p>
<p>A very extraordinary thing, and one that shows the facility with
which the natives learned Spanish, is that fifty years before the
arrival of the Spaniards in Luzon, in that very year 1521 when they
first came to the islands, there were already natives of Luzon who
understood Castilian. In the treaties of peace that the survivors of
Magellan&rsquo;s expedition made with the chief of Paragua, when the
servant-interpreter died <i>they communicated with one another through
a Moro who had been captured in the island of the King of Luzon and who
understood some Spanish</i>. (Martin Mendez, op, cit ) Where did this
extemporaneous interpreter learn Castilian? In the Moluccas? In
Malacca, with the Portuguese? Spaniards did not reach Luzon until
1571.</p>
<p>Legazpi&rsquo;s expedition met in Butuan various traders of Luzon
with their boats laden with iron, wax cloths, porcelain, etc. (Gaspar
de San Agustin,) plenty of provisions, activity, trade, movement in all
the southern islands. (<a href="#n11">11</a>)</p>
<p>They arrived at the Island of Cebu, <i>&ldquo;abounding in
provisions</i>, with mines and washings <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e349" href="#xd21e349" name="xd21e349">22</a>]</span>of gold, and
peopled with natives,&rdquo; as Morga says; &ldquo;very populous, and
at a port frequented by many ships that came from the islands and
kingdoms near India,&rdquo; as Colin says; and even though they were
peacefully received discord soon arose. The city was taken by force and
burned. The fire destroyed the food supplies and naturally famine broke
out in that town of a hundred thousand people, (<a href="#n12">12</a>)
as the historians say, and among the members of the expedition, but the
neighboring islands quickly relieved the need, thanks to the abundance
they enjoyed.</p>
<p>All the histories of those first years, in short, abound in long
accounts about the industry and agriculture of the natives: mines,
gold-washings, looms, farms, barter, naval construction, raising of
poultry and stock, weaving of silk and cotton, distilleries,
manufactures of arms, pearl fisheries, the civet industry, the horn and
hide industry, etc., are things encountered at every step, and,
considering the time and the conditions in the islands, prove that
there was life, there was activity, there was movement.</p>
<p>And if this, which is deduction, does not convince any minds imbued
with unfair prejudices, perhaps of some avail may be the testimony of
the oft-quoted Dr. Morga, who was Lieutenant-Governor of Manila for
seven years and after rendering great service in the Archipelago was
appointed criminal judge of the <i>Audiencia</i> of Mexico and
Counsellor of the Inquisition. His testimony, we say, is highly
credible, not only because all his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e361" href="#xd21e361" name=
"xd21e361">23</a>]</span>contemporaries have spoken of him in terms
that border on veneration but also because his work, from which we take
these citations, is written with great circumspection and care, as well
with reference to the authorities in the Philippines as to the errors
they committed. &ldquo;The natives,&rdquo; says Morga, in chapter VII,
speaking of the occupations of the Chinese, &ldquo;are very far from
exercising those trades and <i>have even forgotten much about farming,
raising poultry, stock and cotton, and weaving cloth</i> AS THEY USED
TO DO IN THEIR PAGANISM AND FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THE COUNTRY WAS
CONQUERED.&rdquo; (<a href="#n13">13</a>)</p>
<p>The whole of chapter VIII of his work deals with this moribund
activity, this <i>much-forgotten</i> industry, and yet in spite of
that, how long is his eighth chapter!</p>
<p>And not only Morga, not only Chirino, Colin, Argensola, Gaspar de
San Agustin and others agree in this matter, but modern travelers,
after two hundred and fifty years, examining the decadence and misery,
assert the same thing. Dr. Hans Meyer, when he saw the unsubdued tribes
cultivating beautiful fields and working energetically, asked if they
would not become indolent when they in turn should accept Christianity
and a paternal government.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Filipinos, in spite of the climate, in spite of
their few needs (they were less then than now), were not the indolent
creatures of our time, and, as we shall see later on, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e379" href="#xd21e379" name=
"xd21e379">24</a>]</span>their ethics and their mode of life were not
what is now complacently attributed to them.</p>
<p>How then, and in what way, was that active and enterprising infidel
native of ancient times converted into the lazy and indolent Christian,
as our contemporary writer&rsquo;s say?</p>
<p>We have already spoken of the more or less latent predisposition
which exists in the Philippines toward indolence, and which must exist
everywhere, in the whole world, in all men, because we all hate work
more or less, as it may be more or less hard, more or less
unproductive. The <i>dolce far niente</i> of the Italian, the
<i>rascarse la barriga</i> of the Spaniard, the supreme aspiration of
the bourgeois to live on his income in peace and tranquility, attest
this.</p>
<p>What causes operated to awake this terrible predisposition from its
lethargy? How is it that the Filipino people, so fond of its customs as
to border on routine, has given up its ancient habits of work, of
trade, of navigation, etc., even to the extent of completely forgetting
its past?</p>

<p class="first">A fatal combination of circumstances, some independent
of the will in spite of men&rsquo;s efforts, others the offspring of
stupidity and ignorance, others the inevitable corollaries of false
principles, and still others the result of more or less base passions
has induced the decline of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e398"
href="#xd21e398" name="xd21e398">25</a>]</span>labor, an evil which
instead of being remedied by prudence, mature reflection and
recognition of the mistakes made, through deplorable policy, through
regret, table blindness and obstinacy, has gone from bad to worse until
it has reached the condition in which we now see it. (<a href=
"#n14">14</a>).</p>
<p>First came the wars, the internal disorders which the new change of
affairs naturally brought with it. It was necessary to subject the
people either by cajolery or force; there were fights, there was
slaughter; those who had submitted peacefully seemed to repent of it;
insurrections were suspected, and some occurred; naturally there were
executions, and many capable laborers perished. Add to this condition
of disorder the invasion of Limahong, add the continual wars into which
the inhabitants of the Philippines were plunged to maintain the honor
of Spain, to extend the sway of her flag in Borneo, in the Moluccas and
in Indo-China; to repel the Dutch foe: costly wars, fruitless
expeditions, in which each time thousands and thousands of native
archers and rowers were recorded to have embarked, but whether they
returned to their homes was never stated. Like the tribute that once
upon a time Greece sent to the Minotaur of Crete, the Philippine youth
embarked for the expedition, saying good-by to their country forever:
on their horizon were the stormy sea, the interminable wars, the rash
expeditions. Wherefore, Gaspar de San Agustin says: &ldquo;Although
anciently there were in this town of <i>Dumangas</i> many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e408" href="#xd21e408" name=
"xd21e408">26</a>]</span>people, in the course of time they <i>have
very greatly diminished because the natives are the best sailors and
most skillful rowers</i> on the whole coast, and so the governors in
the port of Iloilo take <i>most of the people</i> from this town for
the ships that they send abroad ............. When the Spaniards
reached this island (Panay) it is said that there were on it more than
fifty thousand families; but these diminished greatly; ........... and
at present they may amount to some fourteen thousand
tributaries.&rdquo; From fifty thousand families to fourteen thousand
tributaries in little over half a century!</p>
<p>We would never get through, had we to quote all the evidence of the
authors regarding the frightful diminution of the inhabitants of the
Philippines in the first years after the discovery. In the time of
their first bishop, that is, ten years after Legazpi, Philip&nbsp;II
said that they had been reduced to less than two thirds.</p>
<p>Add to these fatal expeditions that wasted all the moral and
material energies of the country, the frightful inroads of the terrible
pirates from the south, instigated and encouraged by the government,
first in order to get complaint and afterwards disarm the islands
subjected to it, inroads that reached the very shores of Manila, even
Malate itself, and during which were seen to set out for captivity and
slavery, in the baleful glow of burning villages, strings of wretches
who had been unable to defend themselves, leaving behind them the ashes
of their homes and the corpses of their parents and children.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e420" href="#xd21e420" name=
"xd21e420">27</a>]</span>Morga, who recounts the first piratical
invasion, says: &ldquo;The boldness of these people of Mindanao did
great damage to the Visayan Islands, as much by what they did in them
as by the fear and fright which the native <i>acquired</i>, because the
latter were in the power of the Spaniards, who held them subject and
tributary and unarmed, <i>in such manner that they did not protect them
from their enemies or leave them means with which to defend
themselves</i>, AS THEY DID WHEN THERE WERE NO SPANIARDS IN THE
COUNTRY.&rdquo; These piratical attacks continually reduced the number
of the inhabitants of the Philippines, since the independent Malays
were especially notorious for their atrocities and murders, sometimes
because they believed that to preserve their independence it was
necessary to weaken the Spaniard by reducing the number of his
subjects, sometimes because a greater hatred and a deeper resentment
inspired them against the Christian Filipinos who, being of the their
own race, served the stranger in order to deprive them of their
precious liberty. These expeditions lasted about three centuries, being
repeated five and ten times a year, and each expedition cost the
islands over eight hundred prisoners.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;With the invasions of the pirates
from Sulu and Mindanao,&rdquo; says Padre Gaspar de San Agustin, [the
island of Bantayan, near Cebu] &ldquo;has been greatly reduced, because
they easily captured the people there, since the latter had no place to
fortify <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e430" href="#xd21e430" name=
"xd21e430">28</a>]</span>themselves and were far from help from Cebu.
The hostile Sulu did great damage in this island in 1608, leaving it
almost <i>depopulated.&rdquo;</i> (Page 380).</p>
<p>These rough attacks, coming from without, produced a counter effect,
in the interior, which, carrying out medical comparisons, was like a
purge or diet in an individual who has just lost a great deal of blood.
In order to make headway against so many calamities, to secure their
sovereignty and take the offensive in these disastrous contests, to
isolate the warlike Sulus from their neighbors in the south, to care
for the needs of the empire of the Indies (for one of the reasons why
the Philippines were kept, as contemporary documents prove, was their
strategic position between New Spain and the Indies), to wrest from the
Dutch their growing colonies of the Moluccas and get rid of some
troublesome neighbors, to maintain, in short, the trade of China with
New Spain. it was necessary to construct new and large ships which, as
we have seen, costly as they were to the country for their equipment
and the rowers they required, were not less so because of the manner in
which they were constructed. (<a href="#n16">16</a>) Fernando de los
Rios Coronel, who fought in these wars and later turned priest,
speaking of these King&rsquo;s ships, said: &ldquo;As they were so
large, the timber needed was scarcely to be found in the forests (of
the Philippines!), and thus it was necessary to seek it with great
difficulty in the most remote of them, where, once found, in order to
haul and convey <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e440" href=
"#xd21e440" name="xd21e440">29</a>]</span>it to the shipyard <i>the
towns of the surrounding country had to be depopulated of natives, who
get it out with immense labor, damage, and cost to them</i>. The
natives furnished the masts for a galleon, according to the assertion
of the Franciscans, and I heard the governor of the province where they
were cut, which is Lacuna de Bay, say that to haul them seven leagues
over very broken mountains <i>6,000 natives were engaged three months,
without furnishing them food, which the wretched native had to seek for
himself!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Gaspar de San Agustin says: &ldquo;In those times (1690),
Bacolor has not the people that it had in the past, because of the
uprising in that province when Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lava was
Governor of these islands and <i>because of the continual labor of
cutting timber for his Majesty&rsquo;s shipyards</i>, WHICH HINDERS
THEM FROM CULTIVATING THE VERY FERTILE PLAIN THEY HAVE.&rdquo;
(<a href="#n17">17</a>)</p>
<p>If this is not sufficient to explain the depopulation of the islands
and the abandonment of industry, agriculture and commerce, then add
<i>&ldquo;the natives who wore executed, those who loft their wives and
children and fled in disgust to the mountains, those who were sold into
slavery to pay the taxes levied upon them,&rdquo;</i> as Fernando de
los Rios Coronel says; add to all this what Philip&nbsp;II said in
reprimanding Bishos Salazar about &ldquo;natives sold by some
<i>encomendoros</i> to others, those flogged to death, the women who
are crushed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e464" href="#xd21e464"
name="xd21e464">30</a>]</span>death by their heavy burdens, those who
sleep in the fields and there bear and nurse their children and die
bitten by poisonous vermin, the many who are executed and left to die
of hunger and those who eat poisonous herbs ............ and the
mothers who kill their children in bearing them,&rdquo; and you will
understand how in less than thirty years the population of the
Philippines was reduced one-third. We are not saying this: it was said
by Gaspar de San Agustin, the preeminently anti-Filipino Augustinian,
and he confirms it throughout the rest of his work by speaking every
moment of the state of neglect in which lay the farms and fields once
so flourishing and so well cultivated, the towns thinned that had
formerly been inhabited by many <i>leading</i> families!</p>
<p>How is it strange, then, that discouragement may have been infused
into the spirit of the inhabitants of the Philippines, when in the
midst of so many calamities they did not know whether they would see
sprout the seed they were planting, whether their field was going to be
their grave or their crop would go to feed their executioner? What is
there strange in it, when we see the pious but impotent friars of that
time trying to free their poor parishioners from the tyranny of the
<i>encomenderos</i> by advising them to stop work in the mines, to
abandon their commerce, to break up their looms, pointing out to them
heaven for their whole hope, preparing them for death as their only
consolation? (<a href="#n18">18</a>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e478" href="#xd21e478" name=
"xd21e478">31</a>]</span>Man works for an object. Remove the object and
you reduce him to inaction The most active man in the world will fold
his arms from the instant he understands that it is madness to bestir
himself, that this work will be the cause of his trouble, that for him
it will be the cause of vexations at home and of the pirate&rsquo;s
greed abroad. It seems that these thoughts have never entered the minds
of those who cry out against the indolence of the Filipinos.</p>
<p>Even were the Filipino not a man like the rest; even were we to
suppose that zeal in him for work was as essential as the movement of a
wheel caught in the gearing of others in motion; even were we to deny
him foresight and the judgment that the past and the present form,
there would still be left us another reason to explain the attack of
the evil. The abandonment of the fields by their cultivators, whom the
wars and piratical attacks dragged from their homes was sufficient to
reduce to nothing the hard labor of so many generations. In the
Philippines abandon for a year the land most beautifully tended and you
will see how you will have to begin all over again: the rain will wipe
out the furrows, the floods will drown the seeds, plants and bushes
will grow up everywhere, and on seeing so much useless labor the hand
will drop the hoe, the laborer will desert his plow. Isn&rsquo;t there
left the fine life of the pirate?</p>
<p>Thus is understood that sad discouragement which we find in the
friar writers of the 17th century, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e485" href="#xd21e485" name="xd21e485">32</a>]</span>speaking of
once very fertile plains submerged, of provinces and towns depopulated,
of products that have disappeared from trade, of leading families
exterminated. These pages resemble a sad and monotonous scene in the
night after a lively day. Of Cagayan Padre San Agustin speaks with
mournful brevity: &ldquo;A great deal of cotton, of which they
<i>made</i> good cloth that the Chinese and Japanese every year
<i>bought</i> and <i>carried</i> away.&rdquo; In the historian&rsquo;s
time, the industry and the trade had come to an end!</p>
<p>It seems that these are causes more thorn sufficient to breed
indolence even in the midst of beehive. Thus is explained why, after
thirty-two years of the system, the circumspect and prudent Morga said
that the natives &ldquo;<i>have forgotten much about farming, raising
poultry, stock and cotton, and weaving cloth, as they used to do in
their paganism and</i> FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN
CONQUERED!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still they struggled a long time against indolence, yes: but their
enemies were so numerous that at last they gave up!</p>

<p class="first">We recognize the causes that, awoke the predisposition
and provoked the evil: now let us see what foster and sustain it. In
this connection, government and governed have to bow our heads and say:
we deserve our fate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e509" href="#xd21e509" name=
"xd21e509">33</a>]</span>We have already truly said that when a house
becomes disturbed and disordered, we should not accuse the youngest,
child or the servants, but the head of it, especially if his authority
is unlimited, he who does not act freely is not responsible for his
actions; and the Filipino people, not being master of its liberty, is
not responsible for either its misfortunes or its woes. We says this,
it is true, but, as will be seen later on, we also have a large part,
in the continuation of such a disorder.</p>
<p>The following, among other causes, contributed to foster the evil
and aggravate it: the constantly lessening encouragement that labor has
met with in the Philippines. Fearing to have the Filipinos deal
frequently with other individuals of their own race, who were free and
independent, as the Borneans, the Siamese, the Cambodians, and the
Japanese, people who in their customs and feeling&rsquo;s differ
greatly from the Chinese, the Government acted toward these others with
great mistrust and great severity, as Morga testifies in the last pages
of his work, until they finally ceased to come to the country. In fact,
it seems that once an uprising&rsquo; planned by the Borneans was
suspected: we say <i>suspected</i>, for there was not even an attempt,
although there were many executions. (<a href="#n19">19</a>) And, as
these nations were the very ones that, consumed Philippine products,
when all communication with them had been cut off, consumption of these
products also ceased. The only two countries with which the Philippines
continued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e519" href="#xd21e519"
name="xd21e519">34</a>]</span>to have relations were China and Mexico,
or New Spain, and from this trade only China and a few private
individuals in Manila got any benefit. It, fact, the Celestial Empire
sent, her junks laden with merchandise, that merchandise which shut
down the factories of Seville and ruined the Spanish industry, and
returned laden in exchange with the silver that was every year sent
from Mexico. Nothing from the Philippines at that time went to China,
not even gold, for in those years the Chinese traders would accept no
payment but silver coin. (<a href="#n20">20</a>) To Mexico went little
more: some cloth and dry goods which the <i>encomendoros</i> took by
force or bought from the natives at, a paltry price, wax, amber, gold,
civet, etc, but nothing more, and not even in great quantity, as is
stated by Admiral Don Jer&oacute;nimo de Ba&ntilde;uelos y Carrillo,
when he begged the King that <i>&ldquo;the inhabitants of the Manilas
be permitted (!) to load as many ships as they could with native
products, such as wax, gold, perfumes, ivory, cotton cloths, which they
would have to buy from the natives of the country ............... Thus
the friendship of those peoples would be gained, they would furnish New
Spain with their merchandise and the money that is brought to Manila,
would not leave this place,&rdquo;</i> (<a href="#n21">21</a>)</p>
<p>The coastwise trade, so active in other times, had to die out,
thanks to the piratical attacks of the Malays of the south; and trade
in the interior of the islands almost entirely disappeared, owing to
restrictions, passports <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e536" href=
"#xd21e536" name="xd21e536">35</a>]</span>and other administrative
requirements.</p>
<p>Of no little importance were the hindrances and obstacles that from
the beginning were thrown in the farmers&rsquo;s way by the rulers, who
were influenced by childish fear and saw everywhere signs of
conspiracies and uprisings. The natives were not allowed to go to their
labors, that is, their farms, <i>without permission of the governor, or
of his agents and officers, and even of the priests</i> as Morga says.
Those who know the administrative slackness and confusion in a country
where the officials work scarcely two hours a day; those who know the
cost of going to and returning from the capital to obtain a permit;
those who are aware of the petty retaliations of the little tyrants
will well understand how with this crude arrangement it is possible to
have the most absurd agriculture. True it is that for some time this
absurdity, which would be ludicrous had it not been so serious, has
disappeared; but even if the words have gone out of use other facts and
other provisions have replaced them. The Moro pirate has disappeared
but there remains the outlaw who infests the fields and waylays the
farmer to hold him for ransom. Now then, the government, which has a
constant fear of the people, denies to the farmers even the use of a
shotgun, or if it does allow it does so very grudgingly and withdraws
it at pleasure; whence it results with the laborer, who, thanks to his
means of defense, plants his crops and invests his meager fortune
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e543" href="#xd21e543" name=
"xd21e543">36</a>]</span>in the furrows that he has so laboriously
opened, that when his crop matures, it occurs to the government, which
is impotent to suppress brigandage, to deprive him of his weapon; and
then, without defense and without security he is reduced to inaction
and abandons his field, his work, and takes to gambling as the best
means of securing a livelihood. The green cloth is under the protection
of the government, it is safer! A mournful counselor is fear, for it
not only causes weakness but also in casting aside the weapons
strengthens the very persecutor!</p>
<p>The sordid return the native gets from his work has the effect of
discouraging him. We know from history that the <i>encomenderos</i>,
after reducing many to slavery and forcing them to work for their
benefit, made others give up their merchandise for a trifle or nothing
at all, or cheated them with false measures.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ipion, in Panay, Padre Gaspar de San Agustin says:
&ldquo;It was in ancient times very rich in gold, ............... but
provoked by the annoyances they suffered from some governors <i>they
have ceased to get it out</i>, preferring to live in poverty than to
suffer such hardships.&rdquo; (Page 378). Further on, speaking of other
towns, he says: &ldquo;Goaded by the ill treatment of the
<i>encomenderos</i> who in administering justice have treated the
natives as their slaves and not as their children, and have only looked
after their own interests at the expense of the wretched fortunes and
lives of their charges ...............&rdquo; (Page 422) Further
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e558" href="#xd21e558" name=
"xd21e558">37</a>]</span>on: &ldquo;In Leyte, where they tried to kill
an <i>encomendero</i> of the town of Dagami on account of the great
hardships he made them suffer by exacting tribute of wax from them with
a steelyard which he had made twice as long as the others&rdquo;</p>
<p>This state of affairs lasted a long time and still lasts, in spite
of the fact, that the breed of <i>encomenderos</i> has become extinct.
A term passes away but the evil and the passions engendered do not pass
away so long as reforms are devoted solely to changing the names.</p>
<p>The wars with the Dutch, the inroads and piratical attacks of the
people of Sulu and Mindanao disappeared; the people have been
transformed; new towns have grown up while others have become
impoverished; but the frauds subsist as much as or worse than they did
in those early years. We will not cite our own experiences, for aside
from the fact that, we do not know which to select, critical persons
may reproach us with partiality; neither will we cite those of other
Filipinos who write in the newspapers; but we shall confine ourselves
to translating the words of a modern French traveler who was in the
Philippines for a long time:</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;The good curate,&rdquo; he says
with reference to the rosy picture a friar had given him of the
Philippines, &ldquo;had not told me about the governor, the foremost
official of the district, who was too much taken up with the ideal of
getting rich to have time to tyrannize over his docile subjects; the
governor, charged with ruling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e572"
href="#xd21e572" name="xd21e572">38</a>]</span>the country and
collecting the various taxes in the government&rsquo;s name, devoted
himself almost wholly to trade; in his hands <i>the high and noble
functions he performs are nothing more than instruments of gain. He
monopolizes all the business and instead of developing on his part the
love of work, instead of stimulating the too natural indolence of the
natives, he with abuse of his powers thinks only of destroying all
competition that may trouble him or attempt to participate in his
profits. It matters little to him that the country is impoverished,
without cultivation, without commerce, without, industry, just so the
governor is quickly enriched!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet the traveler has been unfair in picking out the <i>governor</i>
especially: Why only the governor?</p>
<p>We do not cite passages from other authors, because we have not
their works at hand and do not wish to quote from memory.</p>
<p>The great difficulty that every enterprise encountered with the
administration contributed not a little to kill off all commercial and
industrial movement. All the Filipinos, as well as all those who have
tried to engage in business in the Philippines, know how many
documents, what comings, how many stamped papers, how much patience is
needed to secure from the government a permit for an enterprise. One
must count upon the good will of this one, on the influence of that
one, on a good bribe to another in order that the application be not
pigeonholed, a present to the one further on so that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e587" href="#xd21e587" name=
"xd21e587">39</a>]</span>he may pass it on to his chief; one must pray
to God to give him good humor and time to see and examine it; to
another, talent to recognize its expediency; to one further on
sufficient stupidity not to scent behind the enterprise an
insurrectionary purpose; and that they may not all spend the time
taking baths, hunting or playing cards with the reverend friars in
their convents or country houses. And above all, great patience, great
knowledge of how to get along, plenty of money, a great deal of
politics, many salutations, great influence, plenty of presents and
complete resignation! How is it strange that, the Philippines remain
poor in spite of their very fertile soil, when history tells us that
the countries now the most flourishing date their development from the
day of their liberty and civil rights? The most commercial and most
industrious countries have been the freest countries: France, England
and the United States prove this. Hongkong, which is not worth the most
insignificant of the Philippines, has more commercial movement than all
the islands together, because it is free and is well governed.</p>
<p>The trade with China, which was the whole occupation of the
colonizers of the Philippines, was not only prejudicial to Spain but
also to the life of her colonies; in fact, when the officials and
private persons at Manila found an easy method of getting rich they
neglected everything. They paid no attention either to cultivating the
soil or to fostering industry; and wherefore? China <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e591" href="#xd21e591" name=
"xd21e591">40</a>]</span>furnished the trade, and they had only to take
advantage of it and pick up the gold that dropped out on its way from
Mexico toward the interior of China, the gulf whence it never
returned<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span></p>
<p>The pernicious example of the dominators in surrounding themselves
with servants and despising manual or corporal labor as a thing
unbecoming the nobility and chivalrous pride of the heroes of so many
centuries; those lordly airs, which the natives have translated into
<i>tila ka castila</i>, and the desire of the dominated to be the equal
of the dominators, if not essentially, at least in their manners: all
this had naturally to produce aversion to activity and fear or hatred
of work.</p>
<p>Moreover, &lsquo;Why work?&rsquo; asked many natives. The curate
says that the rich man will not go to heaven The rich man on earth is
liable to all kinds of trouble, to be appointed a <i>cabeza de
barangay</i>, to be deported if an uprising occurs, to be forced banker
of the military chief of the town, who to reward him for favors
received seizes his laborers and his stock, in order to force him to
beg for mercy, and thus easily pays up. Why be rich? So that all the
officers of justice may have a lynx eye on your actions, so that at the
least slip enemies may be raised up against you, you may be indicted, a
whole complicated and labyrinthine story may be concocted against you,
for which you can only get away, not by the thread of Ariadne but by
Danae&rsquo;s shower of gold, and still give thanks that you are not
kept in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e606" href="#xd21e606" name=
"xd21e606">41</a>]</span>reserve for some needy occasion? The native,
whom they pretend to regard as an imbecile, is not so much so that he
does not understand that it is ridiculous to work himself to death to
become worse off. A proverb of his says that <i>the pig is cooked in
its own lard</i>, and as among his bad qualities he has the good one of
applying to himself all the criticisms and censures he prefers to live
miserable and indolent, rather than play the part of the wretched beast
of burden.</p>
<p>Add to this the introduction of gambling. We do not mean to san that
before the coming of the Spaniards the natives did not gamble: the
passion for grumbling is innate in adventuresome and excitable races,
and such is the Malay. Pigafetta tells us of cock-fights and of bets in
the Island of Paragua. Cock-fighting must also have existed in Luzon
and in all the islands, for in the terminology of the game are two
Tagalog words: <i>sabong</i>, and <i>tari</i> (cockpit and gaff). But
there is not the least doubt that the fostering of this game is due to
the government, as well as the perfecting of it. Although Pigafetta
tells us of it, he mentions it only in Paragua, and not in Cebu nor in
any other island of the south, where he stayed long time. Morga does
not speak of it, in spite of his having spent seven years in Manila,
and yet he does describe the kinds of fowl, the jungle hens and cocks.
Neither does Morga, speak of gambling, when he talks about vices and
other defects, more or less concealed, more or less insignificant.
Moreover, excepting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e619" href=
"#xd21e619" name="xd21e619">42</a>]</span>the two Tagalog words
<i>sabong</i> and <i>tari</i>, the others are of Spanish origin, as
<i>soltada</i> (setting the cocks to fight, then the fight itself),
<i>presto</i>, (<i>apuesta</i>, bet), <i>logro</i> (winnings),
<i>pago</i> (payment), <i>sentenciador</i> (referee), <i>case</i> (to
cover the bets), etc. We say the same about gambling: the word <i>sugal
(jugar</i>, to gamble), like <i>kumpisal</i> (<i>confesar</i>, to
confess to a priest), indicates that gambling was unknown in the
Philippines before the Spaniards. The word <i>lar&oacute;</i> (Tagalog,
to play) is not the equivalent of the word <i>sunni</i>. The word
<i>balasa</i> (<i>baraja</i>, playing-card) proves that the
introduction of playing-cards was not due to the Chinese, who have a
kind of playing-cards also, because in that case they would have taken
the Chinese name. Is not this enough? The word <i>tay&aacute;</i>
(<i>taltar</i>, to bet), <i>paris-paris</i> (Spanish <i>pares</i>,
pairs of cards), <i>politana</i> (<i>napolitana</i>, a winning sequence
of cards), <i>sapore</i> (to stack the cards), <i>kapote</i> (to slam),
<i>monte</i>, and so on, all prove the foreign origin of this terrible
plant, which only produces vice, and which has found in the character
of the native a fit soil, cultivated by circumstances.</p>
<p>Along with gambling, which breeds dislike for steady and difficult
toil by its promise of sudden wealth and its appeal to the emotions,
with the lotteries, with the prodigality and hospitality of the
Filipinos, went also, to swell this train of misfortunes, the religious
functions, the great number of fiestas, the long masses for the women
to spend their mornings and the novenaries to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e702" href="#xd21e702" name=
"xd21e702">43</a>]</span>spend their afternoons, and the night, for the
processions and rosaries. Remember that lack of capital and absence of
means paralyze all movement, and you will see how the native has
perforce to be indolent for if any money might remain to him from the
trials, imposts and exactions, he would have to give it to the curate
for bulls, scapularies, candles, novenaries, etc. And if this does not
suffice to form an indolent character, if the climate and nature are
not enough in themselves to daze him and deprive him of all energy,
recall then that the doctrines of his religion teach him to irrigate
his fields in the dry season, not by means of canals but with masses
and prayers; to preserve his stock during an epizootic with holy water,
exorcisms and benedictions that cost five dollars an animal; to drive
away the locusts by a procession with the image of St. Augustine, etc.
It is well, undoubtedly, to trust greatly in God; but it is better to
do what one can and not trouble the Creator every moment, even when
these appeals redound to the benefit of His ministers. We have noticed
that the countries which believe most in miracles are the laziest,
just, as spoiled children are the most ill-mannered. Whether they
believe in miracles to palliate their laziness or they are lazy because
they believe in miracles, we cannot say; but the fact is the Filipinos
were much less lazy before the word <i>miracle</i> was introduced into
their language.</p>
<p>The facility with which individual liberty is curtailed, that
continual alarm of all from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e709"
href="#xd21e709" name="xd21e709">44</a>]</span>knowledge that they are
liable to secret report, a governmental ukase, and to the accusation of
rebel or suspect, an accusation which, to be effective, does not need
proof or the production of the accuser. With that lack of confidence in
the future, that uncertainty of reaping the reward of labor, as in a
city stricken with the plague, everybody yields to fate, shuts himself
in his house or goes about amusing himself in the attempt to spend the
few days that remain to him in the least disagreeable way possible.</p>
<p>The apathy of the government itself toward everything in commerce
and agriculture contributes not a little to foster indolence. There is
no encouragement, at all for the manufacturer or for the farmer; the
government furnishes no aid either when poor crop comes, when the
locusts (<a href="#n23">23</a>) sweep over the fields, or when a
cyclone destroys in its passage the wealth of the soil; nor does it
take any trouble to seek a market for the products of its colonies. Why
should it do so when these same products are burdened with taxes and
imposts and have not free entry into the ports, of the mother country,
nor is their consumption there encouraged? While we see all the walls
of London covered with advertisements of the products of its colonies,
while the English make heroic efforts to substitute Ceylon for Chinese
tea, beginning with the sacrifice of their taste and their stomach, in
Spain, with the exception of tobacco, nothing from the Philippines is
known: neither its sugar, coffee, hemp, fine cloths, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e716" href="#xd21e716" name=
"xd21e716">45</a>]</span>nor its Ilocano blankets. The name of Manila
is known only from those cloths of China or Indo-China which at one
time reached Spain by way of Manila, heavy silk shawls, fantastically
but coarsely embroidered, which no one has thought of imitating in
Manila, since they are so easily made; but the government has other
cares, and the Filipinos do not know that such objects are more highly
esteemed in the Peninsula than their delicate <i>pi&ntilde;a</i>,
embroideries and their very fine <i>jusi</i> fabrics. Thus disappeared
our trade in indigo, thanks to the trickery of the Chinese, which the
government could not guard against, occupied as it was with other
thoughts; thus die now the other industries; the fine manufactures of
the Visayas are gradually disappearing from trade and even from use;
the people, continually getting poorer, cannot afford the costly cloths
and have to be content with calico or the imitations of the Germans,
who produce imitations even of the work of our silversmiths.</p>
<p>The fact that the best plantations, the best tracts of land in some
provinces, those that from their easy access are more profitable than
others, are in the hands of the religious corporations, whose
desideratum is ignorance and a condition of semi-starvation for the
native, so that they may continue to govern him and make themselves
necessary to his wretched existence, is one of the reasons why many
towns do not progress in spite of the efforts of their inhabitants. We
will be met with the objections, as an argument on the other side,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e726" href="#xd21e726" name=
"xd21e726">46</a>]</span>that the towns which belong to the friars are
comparatively richer than those which do not belong to them. They
surely are! Just as their brethren in Europe, in founding their
convents, knew how to select the best valleys, the best uplands for the
cultivation of the vine or the production of beer, so also the
Philippine monks (<a href="#n25">25</a>) have known how to select the
best towns, the beautiful plains, the well-watered fields, to make of
them rich plantations. For some time the friars have deceived many by
making them believe that if these plantations were prospering, it was
because they were under their care, and the indolence of the native was
thus emphasized; but they forget that in same provinces where they have
not been able for some reason to get possession of the best tracts of
land, their plantations, like Baurand and Liang, are inferior to Taal,
Balayan and Lipa, regions cultivated entirely by the natives without
any monkish interference whatsoever.</p>
<p>Add to this lack of material inducement the absentee of moral
stimulus, and you will see how he who is not indolent in that country
must needs be a madman or at least a fool. What future awaits him who
distinguishes himself, him who studies, who rises above the crowd? At
the cost of study and sacrifice a young man becomes a great chemist,
and after a long course of training, wherein neither the government nor
anybody has given him the least help, he concludes his long stay in the
University. A competitive examination is held to fill a certain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e734" href="#xd21e734" name=
"xd21e734">47</a>]</span>position. The young man wins this through
knowledge and perseverance, and after he has won it, it is abolished,
because ......... we do not care to give the reason, but when a
municipal laboratory is closed in order to abolish the position of
director, who got his place by competitive examination, while other
officers, such as the press censor, are preserved, it is because the
belief exists that the light of progress may injure the people more
than all the adulterated foods (<a href="#n26">26</a>). In the same
way, another young man won a prize in a literary competition, and as
long as his origin was unknown his work was discussed, the newspapers
praised it and it was regarded as a masterpiece, but the sealed
envelopes were opened, the winner proved to be a native, while among
the losers there were Peninsulars; then all the newspapers hastened to
extol the losers! Not one word from the government, nor from anybody,
to encourage the native who with so much affection was cultivating the
language and letters of the mother country! (<a href="#n27">27</a>)</p>
<p>Finally, passing over many other more or less insignificant reasons,
the enumeration of which would be interminable, let us close this
dreary list with the principal and most terrible of all: the education
of the native.</p>
<p>From his birth until he sinks into his grave, the training of the
native is brutalizing, depressive and antihuman (the word
&lsquo;inhuman&rsquo; is not sufficiently explanatory: whether or not
the Academy admit it, let it go). There is no doubt that the
government, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e746" href="#xd21e746"
name="xd21e746">48</a>]</span>some priests like the Jesuits and some
Dominicans like Padre Benavides, have done a great deal by founding
colleges, schools of primary instruction, and the like. But this is not
enough; their effect is neutralized. They amount to five or ten years
(years of a hundred and fifty days at most) during which the youth
comes in contact with books selected by those very priests who boldly
proclaim that it is an evil for the natives to know Castilian, that the
native should not be separated from his carabao, that he should not
have any further aspirations, and so on; five to ten years during which
the majority of the students have grasped nothing more than that no one
understands what the books say, not even the professors themselves
perhaps; and these five to ten years have to offset the daily
preachment of the whole life, that preachment which lowers the dignity
of man, which by degrees brutally deprives him of the sentiment of
self-esteem, that eternal, stubborn, constant labor to bow the
native&rsquo;s neck, to make him accept the yoke, to place him on a
level with the beast&mdash;a labor aided by some persons, with or
without the ability to write, which if it does not produce in some
individuals the desired effect, in others it has the opposite effect,
like the breaking of a cord that is stretched too tightly. Thus, while
they attempt to make of the native a kind of animal, vet in exchange
they demand of him divine actions. And we say divine actions, because
he must be a god who does not become <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e748" href="#xd21e748" name="xd21e748">49</a>]</span>indolent in
that climate, surrounded by the circumstances mentioned. Deprive a man,
then, of his dignity, and you not only deprive him of his moral
strength but you also make him useless even for those who wish to make
use of him. Every creature has its stimulus, its mainspring:
man&rsquo;s is his self-esteem. Take it away from him and he is a
corpse, and he who seeks activity in a corpse will encounter only
worms.</p>
<p>Thus is explained how the natives of the present time are no longer
the same as those of the time of the discovery, neither morally nor
physically.</p>
<p>The ancient writers, like Chirino, Morga and Colin, take pleasure in
describing them as <i>well-featured, with good aptitudes for any thing
they take up, keen and susceptible and of resolute will</i>, very
<i>clean and neat in their persons and clothing, and of good mien and
bearing</i>. (Morga). Others delight in minute accounts of their
intelligence and pleasant manners, of their aptitude for music, the
drama, dancing and singing; of the facility with which they learned,
not only Spanish but also Latin, which they acquired almost by
themselves (Colin); others, of their exquisite politeness in their
dealings and in their social life; others, like the first Augustinians,
whose accounts Gaspar de San Augustin copies, found them more gallant
and better mannered than the inhabitants of the Moluccas. <i>&ldquo;All
live off their husbandry,&rdquo;</i> adds Morga, <i>&ldquo;their farms,
fisheries and enterprises</i>, for they travel from island to island by
sea and from province to province by land.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e767" href="#xd21e767" name=
"xd21e767">50</a>]</span>In exchange, the writers of the present time,
without being better than those of former times, neither as men nor as
historians, without being more gallant than Hernan Cortez and Salcedo,
nor more prudent than Legazpi, nor more manly than Morga, nor more
studious than Colin and Gaspar de San Agustin, our contemporary
writers, we say, find that the native is <i>a creature something more
than a monkey but much less than a man, an anthropoid, dull-witted,
stupid, timid, dirty, cringing, grinning, ill-clothed, indolent, lazy,
brainless, immoral</i>, etc., etc.</p>
<p>To what is this retrogression due? Is it the delectable
civilization, the religion of salvation of the friars, called of Jesus
Christ by a euphemism, that has produced this miracle, that has
atrophied his brain, paralyzed his heart and made of the man this sort
of vicious animal that the writers depict?</p>
<p>Alas! The whole misfortune of the present Filipinos consists in that
they have become only half-way brutes. The Filipino is convinced that
to get happiness it is necessary for him to lay aside his dignity as a
rational creature, to attend mass, to believe what is told him, to pay
what is demanded of him, to pay and forever to pay; to work, suffer and
be silent, without aspiring to anything, without aspiring to know or
even to understand Spanish, <i>without separating himself from his
carabao</i>, as the priests shamelessly say, without protesting against
any injustice, against any arbitrary action, against an assault,
against an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e779" href="#xd21e779"
name="xd21e779">51</a>]</span>insult; that is, not to have heart, brain
or spirit: a creature with arms and a purse full of gold ............
there&rsquo;s the ideal native! Unfortunately, or because the
brutalization is not yet complete and because the nature of man is
inherent in his being in spite of his condition, the native protests;
he still has aspirations, he thinks and strives to rise, and
there&rsquo;s the trouble!</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the preceding chapter we set forth the causes that
proceed from the government in fostering and maintaining the evil we
are discussing. Now it falls to us to analyze those that emanate from
the people. Peoples and governments are correlated and complementary: a
fatuous government would be an anomaly among righteous people, just as
a corrupt people cannot exist under just rulers and wise laws. Like
people, like government, we will say in paraphrase of a popular
adage.</p>
<p>We can reduce all these causes to two classes: to defects of
training and lack of national sentiment.</p>
<p>Of the influence of climate we spoke at the beginning, so we will
not treat of the effects arising from it.</p>
<p>The very limited training in the home, the tyrannical and sterile
education of the rare centers of learning, that blind subordination of
the youth to one of greater age, influence the mind so that a man may
not aspire to excel those who preceded him but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e792" href="#xd21e792" name=
"xd21e792">52</a>]</span>must merely be content to go along with or
march behind them. Stagnation forcibly results from this, and as he who
devotes himself merely to copying divests himself of other qualities
suited to his own nature, he naturally becomes sterile; hence
decadence. Indolence is a corollary derived from the lack of stimulus
and of vitality.</p>
<p>That modesty infused into the convictions of every one, or, to speak
more clearly, that insinuated inferiority, a sort of daily and constant
depreciation of the mind so that, it may not be raised to the regions
of light, deadens the energies, paralyzes all tendency toward
advancement, and at the least struggle a man gives up without fighting.
If by one of those rare accidents, some wild spirit, that is, some
active one, excels, instead of his example stimulating, it only causes
others to persist in their inaction. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s one who will
work for us: let&rsquo;s sleep on!&rsquo; say his relatives and
friends. True it is that the spirit of rivalry is sometimes awakened,
only that then it awakens with bad humor in the guise of envy, and
instead of being a lever for helping, it is an obstacle that produces
discouragement.</p>
<p>Nurtured by the example of anchorites of a contemplative and lazy
life, the natives spend theirs in giving their gold to the Church in
the hope of miracles and other wonderful things. Their will is
hypnotized: from childhood they learn to act mechanically, without
knowledge of the object, thanks to the exercises imposed upon them from
the tenderest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e798" href="#xd21e798"
name="xd21e798">53</a>]</span>years of praying for whole hours in an
unknown tongue, of venerating things that they do not understand, of
accepting beliefs that are not explained to them to having absurdities
imposed upon them, while the protests of reason are repressed. Is it
any wonder that with this vicious <i>dressage</i> of intelligence and
will the native, of old logical and consistent&mdash;as the analysis of
his past and of his language demonstrates&mdash;should now be a mass of
dismal contradictions? That continual struggle between reason and duty,
between his organism and his new ideals, that civil war which disturbs
the peace of his conscience all his life, has the result, of paralyzing
all his energies, and aided by the severity of the climate, makes of
that eternal vacillation, of the doubts in his brain, the origin of his
indolent disposition.</p>
<p class="indent-hang-medium">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t know more than
this or that old man!&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t aspire to be greater
than the curate!&rdquo; &ldquo;You belong to an inferior race!&rdquo;
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any energy!&rdquo; This is what they tell the
child, and as they repeat it so often, it has perforce to become
engraved on his mind and thence mould and pervade all his actions. The
child or youth who tries to be anything else is blamed with vanity and
presumption; the curate ridicules him with cruel sarcasm, his relatives
look upon him with fear, strangers regard him with great compassion. No
forward movement! Get back in the ranks and keep in line!</p>
<p>With his spirit thus moulded the native falls into the most
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e807" href="#xd21e807" name=
"xd21e807">54</a>]</span>pernicious of all routines: routine not
planned, but imposed and forced. Note that the native himself is not,
naturally inclined to routine, but his mind is disposed to accept all
truths, just as his house is open to all strangers. The good and the
beautiful attract him, seduce and captivate him, although, like the
Japanese, he often exchanges the good for the evil, if it appears to
him garnished and gilded. What he lacks is in the first place liberty
to allow expansion to his adventuresome spirit, and good examples,
beautiful prospects for the future. It is necessary that his spirit,
although it may be dismayed and cowed by the elements and the fearful
manifestation of their mighty forces, store up energy, seek high
purposes, in order to struggle against obstacles in the midst of
unfavorable natural conditions. In order that he may progress it is
necessary that a revolutionary spirit, so to speak, should boil in his
veins, since progress necessarily requires change; it implies the
overthrow of the past, there deified, by the present; the victory of
new ideas over the ancient and accepted ones. It will not be sufficient
to speak to his fancy, to talk nicely to him, nor that the light
illuminate him like the ignis fatuus that leads travelers astray at
night; all the flattering promises of the fairest hopes will not
suffice, so long as his spirit is not free, his intelligence not
respected.</p>
<p>The reasons that originate in the lack of national sentiment are
still more lamentable and more transcendental.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e812" href="#xd21e812" name=
"xd21e812">55</a>]</span>Convinced by the insinuation of his
inferiority, his spirit harassed by his education, if that
brutalization of which we spoke above can be called education, in that
exchange of usages and sentiments among different nations, the
Filipino, to whom remain only his susceptibility and his poetical
imagination, allows himself to be guided by his fancy and his
self-love. It is sufficient that the foreigner praise to him the
imported merchandise and run down the native product for him to hasten
to make the change, without reflecting that everything has its weak
side and the most sensible custom is ridiculous in the eyes of those
who do not follow it. They have dazzled him with tinsel, with strings,
of colored glass beads, with noisy rattles, shining mirrors and other
trinkets, and he has given in return his gold, his conscience, and even
his liberty. He changed his religion for the external practices of
another cult; the convictions and usages derived from his climate and
needs, for other usages and other convictions that developed under
another sky and another inspiration. His spirit, well-disposed toward
everything that looks good to him, was then transformed, at the
pleasure of the nation that forced upon him its God and its laws, and
as the trader with whom he dealt did not bring a cargo of useful
implements of iron, hoes to till the fields, but stamped papers,
crucifixes, bulls and prayer-books; as he did not have for ideal and
prototype the tanned and vigorous laborer, but the aristocratic lord,
carried in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e814" href="#xd21e814"
name="xd21e814">56</a>]</span>a luxurious litter, the result was that
the imitative people became bookish, devout, prayerful; it acquired
ideas of luxury and ostentation, without thereby improving the means of
its subsistence to a corresponding degree.</p>
<p>The lack of national sentiment brings another evil, moreover, which
is the absence of all opposition to measures prejudicial to the people
and the absence of any initiative in whatever may redound to its good.
A man in the Philippines is only an individual, he is not a member of a
nation. He is forbidden and denied the right of association, and is
therefore weak and sluggish. The Philippines are an organism whose
cells seem to have no arterial system to irrigate it or nervous system
to communicate its impressions; these cells must, nevertheless, yield
their product, get it where they can: if they perish, let them perish.
In the view of some this is expedient so that a colony may be a colony;
perhaps they are right, but not to the effect that a colony may
flourish.</p>
<p>The result of this is that if a prejudicial measure is ordered, no
one protests; all goes well apparently until later the evils are felt.
Another blood-letting, and as the organism has neither nerves nor voice
the physician proceeds in the belief that the treatment is not injuring
it. It needs a reform, but as it must not speak, it keeps silent and
remains with the need. The patient wants to eat, it wants to breathe
the fresh air, but as such desires may offend the susceptibility of the
physician who thinks that he has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e821" href="#xd21e821" name="xd21e821">57</a>]</span>already
provided everything necessary, it suffers and pines away from fear of
receiving scolding, of getting another plaster and a new blood-letting,
and so on indefinitely.</p>
<p>In addition to this, love of peace and the horror many have of
accepting the few administrative positions which fall to the Filipinos
on account of the trouble and annoyance these cause them places at the
head of the people the most stupid and incapable men, those who submit
to everything, those who can endure all the caprices and exactions of
the curate and of the officials. With this inefficiency in the lower
spheres of power and ignorance and indifference in the upper, with the
frequent changes and the eternal apprenticeships, with great fear and
many administrative obstacles, with a voiceless people that has neither
initiative nor cohesion, with employees who nearly all strive to amass
a fortune and return home, with inhabit, ants who live in great
hardship from the instant they begin to breathe, create prosperity,
agriculture and industry, found enterprises and companies, things that
still hardly prosper in free and well-organized communities.</p>
<p>Yes, all attempt is useless that does not spring from a profound
study of the evil that afflicts us. To combat this indolence, some have
proposed increasing the native&rsquo;s needs and raising the taxes.
What has happened? Criminals have multiplied, penury has been
aggravated. Why? Because the native already has enough needs with his
functions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e827" href="#xd21e827"
name="xd21e827">58</a>]</span>of the Church, with his fiestas, with the
public offices forced on him, the donations and bribes that he has to
make so that he may drag out his wretched existence. The cord is
already too taut.</p>
<p>We have heard many complaints, and every day we read in the papers
about the efforts the government is making to rescue the country from
its condition of indolence. Weighing its plans, its illusions and its
difficulties, we are reminded of the gardener who tried to raise a tree
planted in a small flower-pot. The gardener spent his days tending and
watering the handful of earth, he trimmed the plant frequently, he
pulled at it to lengthen it and hasten its growth, he grafted on it
cedars and oaks, until one day the little tree died, leaving the man
convinced that it belonged to a degenerate species, attributing the
failure of his experiment to everything except the lack of soil and his
own ineffable folly.</p>
<p>Without education and liberty, that soil and that sun of mankind, no
reform is possible, no measure can give the result desired. This does
not mean that we should ask first for the native the instruction of a
sage and all imaginable liberties, in order then to put a hoe in his
hand or place him in a workshop; such a pretension would be an
absurdity and vain folly. What we wish is that obstacles be not put in
his way, that the many his climate and the situation of the islands
afford be not augmented, that instruction be not begrudged him for fear
that when he becomes intelligent he may separate from the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e833" href="#xd21e833" name=
"xd21e833">59</a>]</span>colonizing nation or ask for the rights of
which he makes himself worthy. Since some day or other he will become
enlightened, whether the government wishes it or not, let his
enlightenment be as a gift received and not as conquered plunder. We
desire that the policy be at once frank and consistent, that is, highly
civilizing, without sordid reservations, without distrust, without fear
or jealousy, wishing the good for the sake of the good, civilization
for the sake of civilization, without ulterior thoughts of gratitude,
or else boldly exploiting, tyrannical and selfish without hypocrisy or
deception, with a whole system well-planned and studied out for
dominating by compelling obedience, for commanding to get rich, for
getting rich to be happy. If the former, the government may act with
the security that some day or other it will reap the harvest and will
find a people its own in heart and interest; there is nothing like a
favor for securing the friendship or enmity of man, according to
whether it be conferred with good will or hurled into his face and
bestowed upon him in spite of himself. If the logical and regulated
system of exploitation be chosen, stifling with the jingle of gold and
the sheen of opulence the sentiments of independence in the colonies,
paying with its wealth for its lack of liberty, as the English do in
India, who moreover leave the government to native rulers, then build
roads, lay out highways, foster the freedom of trade; let the
government heed material interests more than the interests <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e835" href="#xd21e835" name=
"xd21e835">60</a>]</span>of four orders of friars; let it send out
intelligent employees to foster industry; just judges, all well paid,
so that they be not venal pilferers, and lay aside all religious
pretext. This policy has the advantage in that while it may not lull
the instincts of liberty wholly to sleep, yet the day when the mother
country loses her colonies she will at least have the gold amassed and
not the regret of having reared ungrateful children.</p>

<p>An eminent student of Philippine life and history, James A. LeRoy in
his &ldquo;The Philippines, 1860&ndash;1898&mdash;Some comment and
bibliographical notes&rdquo; published in volume 52 of Blair and
Robertson, <i>Philippine Islands 1493&ndash;1898</i>, praises this book
(p. 141) as &ldquo;especially valuable on administrative matters just
prior to the revision of the fiscal regime in connection with the
abolition of the government tobacco monopoly&rdquo;, and for its
&ldquo;data on land, commerce, and industry&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. Before 1590, one of the Spanish officers in the Philippines,
commenting on the climate of the Islands, declared, with considerable
acumen, that Europeans could stand life and work here if they observed
continence in regard to the use of alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p id="n3">3. See Morga&rsquo;s &ldquo;Report of conditions in the
Philippines (June 8, 1598)&rdquo; in Blair and Robertson vol. 10. pp.
75&ndash;80, in which various abuses of the friars are set forth. This
should be compared with the following pages of the same relation (pp.
89&ndash;90) on secular affairs, from which it will be recognized that
the condition was not so much the resultant of one class as of Spanish
national character. Cf. also, Anda y Salazar B. and R, vol. 50, pp.
137&ndash;190; and Le Gentil, Voyage (Paris, 1779&ndash;81), vol. 1,
pp. 183&ndash;191. It would be hardly fair not to call to mind that the
Filipinos are debtors to the friars in many ways, and the Filipinos
themselves should be the last to forget this. For a good exposition
from the friar point of view, see <span class="bibl" lang="es">Zamora,

<p id="n4">4. The history of the Philippines is full of references to
Chinese who came here for the reasons assigned by Rizal. The
antiquarian will be interested in consulting a small work entitled
<i>Notes on the Malay Archipelago and Malacca, compiled from Chinese
sources</i>, by W. P. Groeneveldt.</p>
<p id="n5">5 See B. and R., vol 34, pp. 183&ndash;191 for a description
of the early Chinese trade in the Philippines, also translated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e877" href="#xd21e877" name=

not the same as referred to by Rizal,</p>
<p id="n6">6. This citation is translated directly from the original
Italian Ms. Rizal&rsquo;s account is seen to be slightly different and
arises from the fact that he made use of Amoretti&rsquo;s printed
version of the Ms., which is wrong in many particulars. Amoretti
attempted to change the original Ms. into modern Italian, with
disastrous result. It is to be regretted that Walls y Merino followed
the same garbled text, in his Primer viaje alrededor del Mundo (Madrid,
1899).</p>
<p>Dr. Antonio de Morga&rsquo;s book is perhaps the most famous of all
the early books treating of the Philippines. Its full title is as
follows: &ldquo;<span lang="es">Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas:
Dirigido &aacute; Don Cristoval Gomez de Sandoval y Rojas, Duque de
Cea, Mexico, En casa de Geronymo Balli, 1609.</span>&rdquo; The
original edition is very rare, and is worth almost its weight in gold.
The manuscript circulated for some years before the date of
publication.</p>
<p>The second Spanish edition of the work was published by Rizal
himself, who was always a sincere admirer of the book. It bears the
following title-page: <span lang="es">&ldquo;Sucesos de las Islas
Filipinas por el Doctor Antonio de Morga. Obra publicada en Mejico el
a&ntilde;o de 1609 nuevamente sacada &aacute; luz y anotada por
Jos&eacute; Rizal y precedida de un pr&oacute;logo del Prof. Fernando
Blumentritt. Paris, Libreria de Garnier Hermanos, 1890.&rdquo;</span>
Shortly before Rizal began work on his edition, a Spanish scholar,
Justo Zaragoza, began the publication of a new edition of Morga. The
book was reprinted, but the notes, prologue, and life of Morga which
Zargoza had intended to insert, were never completed because of that
editor&rsquo;s death. Only two copies of this edition, so far as known,
were ever bound, one of which belongs to the Ayer collection in
Chicago, and the other by the Tabacalera purchase to the Philippine
Library, in Manila. Still one other Spanish edition has appeared,
namely: <span lang="es">&ldquo;Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas por el

Retana <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e894" href="#xd21e894" name=
"xd21e894">63</a>]</span>adds a life of Morga and numerous documents
written by him. An English edition was published as follows: &ldquo;The
Philippine Islands, Moluccas, Siam, Cambodia, Japan, and China. at the
close of the sixteenth century. By Antonio de Morga. Translated from
the Spanish, with notes and a preface, and a letter from Luis Vaez de
Torres, describing his voyage through the Torres Straits, by the Hen.
Henry E. J. Stanley, London, Printed for the Hakluyt Society,
1868&rdquo;. However, Stanley&rsquo;s translation is poor, and parts of
passages are not translated at all. [It was this edition then in
preparation by the Hakluyt Society, which Sir John Bowring, a director
of the society, mentioned on his visit to Rizal&rsquo;s uncle in
Bi&ntilde;an, so that to make the book available to Spaniards and
Filipinos became an ambition from childhood with Rizal.&mdash;C.] A
second English translation appears in B. and R. vols. 15 and 16. A
separate copy of this translation was also published in a very limited
edition, with the title: &ldquo;History of the Philippine Islands from
their discovery by Magellan in 1521 to the beginning of the XVII
century; with descriptions of Japan, China and adjacent countries, by
Dr. Antonio de Morga, alcalde of criminal causes, in the Royal
Audiencia of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and counsel for the Holy Office of
the inquisition. Completely translated into English, edited and
annotated by E. H. Blair and J. A. Robertson. Cleveland, Ohio, The
Arthur H. Clark Company, 1907.&rdquo; See B. and R. vols. 9&ndash;12
for other documents by Morga, and vol. 53 (or Robertson&rsquo;s
Bibliography of the Philippine Islands, Cleveland, 1908), for
bibliographical details regarding Morga and titles to documents.
Perhaps the most famous of all his writings outside of his book is his
relation mentioned <a href="#n3"><i>ante</i>, note 3</a>.</p>

<p id="n10">10. See B. and R., vol. 33, pp. 233&ndash;235. The original
says the ransom included 150 chickens; hence 450, an error due again to
Amoretti.</p>

Fillpinas</i> (Madrid, 1698). There is no doubt of the frequency of
inter-island trade among the peoples of the Philippines at an early
period. Trade was stimulated by the very fact that the Malay peoples,
except those who have been driven into the mountainous interiors, are
by their very nature a seafaring people. The fact of an inter-island
traffic is indicative of a culture above that possessed by a people in
the barbarian stage of culture. Of course, there was considerable
Chinese trade as well throughout the islands.</p>
<p id="n12">12. This estimate is somewhat high. A writer in speaking of
the population of Manila, the metropolis of the Philippines then as
now, about 1570 says that its population scarcely reached 80,000,
instead of the 200,000 reported.</p>
<p id="n13">13. Licentiate Pedro de Rojas, of the Manila Audiencia, in
a letter to Felipe&nbsp;II, June 30, 1586&mdash;Vol.6, pp.
265&ndash;274 says (p. 270): &ldquo;If there were no trade with China,
the citizens of these islands, would be richer; for the natives if they
had not so many tostons, would pay their tributes in the articles which
they produce, and which are current, that is, cloths, lampotes, cotton,
and gold.&mdash;all of which have great value in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.
These they cease to produce because of the abundance of silver; and
what is worse and entails more loss upon your Majesty, is that they do
not, as formerly, work the mines and take out gold&rdquo;. The old
records contains numerous references to the decline of the native
industries of the Philippines after the arrival of the Spaniards and
the increase of Chinese trade.</p>
<p id="n14">14. See <a href="#n13"><i>ante</i>, note 13</a>.</p>
<p id="n15">15. The decrease of population among native people in the
Philippines after the arrival of the Spaniards compares in no degree
with what occurred in America. A most distressing picture of conditions
in the Philippines is given by Bishop Domingo de Salazar in his
relation written about 1583 (see B. &amp; R., vol 5, pp. 210&ndash;255.
See especially p. 212.) It is well to balance Salazar&rsquo;s account
with those of others.</p>
<p>(A &ldquo;tributary&rdquo; was generally reckoned as <i>five</i>
persons, one &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; being required for each adult male.
Hence &ldquo;tributaries&rdquo; and &ldquo;families&rdquo; may here be
taken to mean about the same number,&mdash;D.<span class="corr" title=

<p id="n16"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e941" href="#xd21e941"

Spaniards in shipbuilding formed one of the legitimate causes of
complaint among the people almost from the beginning.</p>
<p id="n17">17. See <a href="#n15"><i>ante</i>, note 15</a>, also
<a href="#n16">note 16</a>.</p>
<p id="n18">18. The early friars, although many of them fell into some
of the very faults which they condemned, inveighed boldly against the
cruelty of the Spaniards. Doubtless their attitude did encourage their
converts to withdraw from industry to a certain degree.</p>
<p id="n19">19. See B. &amp; R, vol. 4, pp. 148&ndash;303.</p>
<p id="n20">20 See B &amp; R., vol. 6, for early accounts of Chinese
trade and Spanish measures affecting it The hostility between Spaniards
and Portuguese enters largely into the question. The effects of the
deplorably bad economics of Spain in its trade relations are still felt
in the Peninsula.</p>
<p id="n21">21. See <a href="#n20"><i>ante</i>, note 20</a>.</p>
<p>22. See <a href="#n20"><i>ante</i>, note 20</a>. The arrival and
departure of the annual galleon were times of activity, but otherwise
Manila was a dull town, with little industry. The Chinese usurped all
the petty trade.</p>
<p id="n23">23 It is to the credit, of the Sociedad Econ&oacute;mica de
Amigos del Pais de Filipinas, founded by the energetic governor Basco y
Vargas in 1781, that it extended its many-sided interests to the
destruction of the devastating hordes of locusts that visit the
Philippines so frequently.</p>
<p>24 The Spanish policy remained to the end one of exclusion, and the
privileges granted were almost all because of coercion, and the
penetrating force of modern ideas.</p>
<p id="n25">25. A loose use of the word &ldquo;monk&rdquo;, which is
properly used of a cloistered ecclesiastic who does not leave his
convent. &ldquo;Friar&rdquo; would be a more exact term. The
Benedictines are monks; the Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans, and
Recollects, are friars.</p>
<p id="n26">26. This was the Filipino chemist Anacleto del Rosario,
whom Rizal rightly praises.</p>
<p id="n27">27. This refers doubtless to Rizal himself, who competed in
an open contest for <i>Spaniards and Indians</i>, of the <span lang=
"es">Liceo Artistico-Literario de Manila</span>, and of whom such an
occurrence is related. He was awarded first prose prize for a
production entitled &ldquo;<span lang="es">El Consejo de los
